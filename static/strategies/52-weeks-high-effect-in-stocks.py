# https://quantpedia.com/strategies/52-weeks-high-effect-in-stocks/
#
# The investment universe consists of all stocks from NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ (the research paper used the CRSP 
# database for backtesting). The ratio between the current price and 52-week high is calculated for each stock 
# at the end of each month (PRILAG i,t = Price i,t / 52-Week High i,t). Every month, the investor then calculates
# the weighted average of ratios (PRILAG i,t) from all firms in each industry (20 industries are used), where the
# weight is the market capitalization of the stock at the end of month t. The winners (losers) are stocks in the
# six industries with the highest (lowest) weighted averages of PRILAGi,t. The investor buys stocks in the winner
# portfolio and shorts stocks in the loser portfolio and holds them for three months. Stocks are weighted equally
# and the portfolio is rebalanced monthly (which means that 1/3 of the portfolio is rebalanced each month).
#
# QC implementation changes:
#   - Universe consists of 500 most liquid stocks traded on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ.
#
# Personal notes:
#   - Reduced coarse_count from 500 to 300 to speed up backtesting during experimentation.
#   - Starting from 2010 to focus on more recent market behavior.
