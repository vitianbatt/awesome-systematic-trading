# https://quantpedia.com/strategies/12-month-cycle-in-cross-section-of-stocks-returns/
#
# The top 30% of firms based on their market cap from NYSE and AMEX are part of the investment universe. Every month, stocks are grouped 
# into ten portfolios (with an equal number of stocks in each portfolio) according to their performance in one month one year ago. Investors
# go long in stocks from the winner decile and shorts stocks from the loser decile. The portfolio is equally weighted and rebalanced every month.
#
# QC implementation changes:
#   - Universe consists of top 3000 US stock by market cap from NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ.
#   - Portfolio is value weighted.
#
# Personal notes:
#   - Increased coarse_count from 500 to 1000 to better approximate the top 30% of NYSE/AMEX universe
#     as described in the original paper. Larger universe should improve decile separation.
